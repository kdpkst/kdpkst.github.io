implement the functionality for user to copy my email: when a user hovers over email icon (the code is in social-icons.html), "copy" button appears (ensure it is easy for user to move cursor to this button and click). the effects have to be as below:
1. when a user hovers over email icon, the "copy" button appears. if the user's cursor moves out of email icon, the "copy" button should dispear
2. if the user clicks "copy" button, it shows a green tick (or text "Copied!") to notify user it has been copie. After 2 sec, the prompt messages should dispear
ensure the design align with the style of the website and easy for user to know "this is the copy button"
