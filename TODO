after hosting on github.io, the section switch animation has partly lost, the part of next section emerges in the webpage is lost, the others are left
beautify the text in navbar: change the font to 3D font (use SCSS, or additional gems if appropriate)
when switcing background images, the animation includes a very short period of "screen color become darker". keep all other settings unchanged, remove this effect.
